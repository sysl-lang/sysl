/** Where a caret lands, for the diagnostics that name a thing rather than a construct.
 *
 * **The rule this suite pins: a message that names an identifier points at that identifier.** A
 * caret under the punctuation beside it sends the reader one column away from the word they were
 * just told about — and where a single mistake produces several of these, as one `val` bound to a
 * mutable object does, the reader is looking in the wrong place several times.
 *
 * It is **not** a rule about every diagnostic. An expression's position is its start, deliberately,
 * which is why an `if` keeps the column of its keyword (`DiagnosticTests` pins that one). What is
 * asserted here is narrower: where the message names the thing to change, the caret is under it.
 *
 * A binary operator's mismatch is the second case of that, and it is a message naming *two* types
 * and complaining about the second. It points at the right operand — the one the reader edits —
 * rather than at the start of the expression. The dispatched path had always done so; the scalar
 * path pointed at the start, so `1 + "x"` and a `Box[int] + string` disagreed about where a mismatch
 * lives. They agree here.
