/** What a module that declared `no alloc` may not do: make heap storage (`reference/modules.md §
 * Capabilities are a module property`).
 *
 * **It is asked of the typed tree rather than of each construction as it is built**, and that is the
 * whole design here. The constructions that allocate are written down in a dozen places across the
 * analyzer — a value boxed by its context, a slice whose elements are counted, every operation that
 * builds a fresh `string` — and a guard at each of them is a list nobody can read and that a
 * thirteenth site would quietly not join. The typed tree has the opposite property: a node that
 * allocates is a node, so the list below is the whole answer and a new one either appears in it or
 * is visibly absent.
 *
 * What is refused is **making** storage, never holding it. A `&T` handed in is retained and released
 * with no allocator in sight, because every object carries its own deallocation hook (`03`) — so an
 * allocator-free module can take a reference, keep it in a field, and drop it, and only the moment
 * the object came into being is gated.
 *
 * A module's own declarations are what it is held to. A call into a module that allocates is a
 * question about the module *graph*, and is answered where the graph is.

   * refuse every `no alloc` module that names anything at all — `print` and `from_utf8` are the

   * that are themselves no-alloc-compatible", and calls are what this is stated over.

   * function nobody calls costs a symbol and dropping one the program reaches is a link error. Asked
   * for a capability the same answer refuses a module for what somebody else's code does: writing
   * into a caller's sink was judged against `sysl.buf`'s `ByteSink`, so a module rendering into a
   * `*Writer` was legal or refused according to what the *program* linked, and no `Display` in
   * `library/` could carry the clause at all.
   *
   * **What is not relaxed is making the sink yourself.** A body that builds a growable buffer and
   * hands it over as a trait object wrote the erasure, so the table is named in its own tree and the
   * walk follows it — which is the case that would otherwise escape, and the reason this is a
   * narrowing rather than a hole.
