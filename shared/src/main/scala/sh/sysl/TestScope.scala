/** Who may name what a `@tests` file declares (`testing.md`).
 *
 * The header says two things and this is the second of them. The first — that every build but a test
 * build drops the file — is `Tests.strip`'s, and on its own it would be unsound: a program that
 * called a helper would compile here and fail at the link, with a message about a missing symbol
 * rather than about the line that named it.
 *
 * So the rule is stated over the **referring declaration** rather than over the file it sits in:
 *
 *   - a declaration in a `@tests` file may name another, since the two are dropped together;
 *   - a `@test` function may name one wherever it was written, because `testing.md` puts a test
 *     beside what it tests and `Tests.strip` drops it in the same builds;
 *   - anything else may not, and is told so where it wrote the name.
 *
 * That the two halves agree is what makes the drop safe rather than lucky: every reference into a
 * test file comes from something dropped in exactly the builds the file is, so a tree that has been
 * stripped can hold no reference to anything that went with it.
 *
 * **Asked of the typed tree**, for the reason `Purity`'s question is: a name reaches a declaration
 * through a dozen paths in the analyzer — a call, an operator that lowered to one, a function's
 * address, a read of module storage — and a guard at each is a list a thirteenth path would quietly
 * not join. A reference is a *node*, so the nodes are the whole answer.

   * the mistake, and the one a reader is likeliest to make while moving code out of a test.
