"""Build CHANGELOG.md from this repository's GitHub releases.

The release bodies are the canonical text -- they are written when the release is cut, while the
reasoning is still to hand, and they are what somebody arriving from the releases page reads. This
script gathers them into one file so that the same history is readable from a clone, offline, and in
a diff. Nothing here writes prose: a claim that is wrong in CHANGELOG.md is wrong on the release it
came from, and that is the copy to correct.

Run it as the last step of a release, once the new release exists:

    ./changelog.py

It needs `gh` authenticated against this repository and makes one API call per release.
