 *
 * This is the seam a C library reaches back through. `extern` (`12 §1`) lets sysl call outward, and
 * that was enough while every foreign interface was one a program calls; it is not enough for the
 * ones that call *back*. `qsort` wants a comparison, `signal` wants a handler, `pthread_create`
 * wants a thread body, and every one of them takes it as an address. Symmetrically, `dlsym` hands an
 * address *in*, and until something could be called through one that whole interface was declarable
 * and unusable.
 *
 * Both directions are the same value — one word holding the address of code compiled to the
 * machine's C convention — so both are `Type.CFn`, and neither is a sysl callable. A `Fn` is a trait
 * (`12 §6`): a bound at a parameter, a two-word object where a concrete type is required, and in
 * both cases something with an environment beside it. C has no notion of an environment, which is
 * why this is a separate type rather than a third mode of that one, and it is why nothing here can
 * take the address of a closure.
