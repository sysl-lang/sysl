# The Native gate: the whole test suite, on the platform a release ships.
#
#     ./run-gate.sh
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT `sbt syslNative/test`
#
# Because that command cannot finish here, at any setting, and the reason is structural rather than
# a matter of tuning. sbt forks one test agent per core and keeps each one for the whole run, so a
# single invocation accumulates the entire suite's retained memory in a handful of processes. Raise
# the heap ceiling and the total overruns the machine; lower it and an agent reaches the ceiling --
# where Scala Native's collector does not abort but **spirals**, collecting and reclaiming nothing,
# at around 80% CPU, for as long as it is left alone. One agent burned 93 minutes of CPU that way
# having printed nothing for two hours, which is indistinguishable from a slow test.
#
# Running one `sbt` per group of suites recycles the agents between groups, and that is the whole
# trick. Measured 2026-08-08 on an 18-core, 64 GB machine: 7798 tests, 0 failures, 7m17s.
#
# THIS IS A WORKAROUND AND SHOULD BE READ AS ONE. The underlying fact is that the suite needs
# roughly twelve times the memory on Native that it needs on the JVM, where the same 7798 tests fit
# in `-Xmx8g`. Nobody has explained the gap. If it is ever closed, delete this script.
#
# EVERY GROUP HAS A HARD TIME LIMIT, because the failure mode above is silence, and silence looks
# exactly like progress. A group that exceeds it is killed and recorded together with the last suite
# it announced, which is what names the offender.
#
# **A KILLED GROUP IS RE-RUN BEFORE IT IS BELIEVED, AND THAT IS NEW AS OF 2026-08-25 (card 0270).**
# A kill produces **no verdict** -- which is a reason to run the group again, not a reason to call
# the gate red. It is retried once, alone, at the heavy settings, and only a second failure is a
# `TIMEOUT`. A group that ran and *reported failures* is never retried: the empty result is the
# distinction, and retrying a real failure is how a gate stops meaning anything.
#
# Cutting 0.0.79 this read `GATE: RED` with **9926 succeeded, 0 failed** and two killed chunks, both
# of which passed untouched when re-run by hand. That is a false red, and a false red is worse than a
# slow gate because it teaches the next one to be discounted.

# **WHY 3 x 16g RATHER THAN 4 x 12g, measured 2026-08-22 cutting 0.0.66.** A wedged chunk was caught
# in the act: four agents sat at **4.3 GB** each and the fifth at **exactly 12.0 GB**, which is the
# cap. The machine was nowhere near full at the time. So the agent that died did not run out of
# memory -- it ran out of *permission*, while tens of gigabytes sat unused beside it.
#
# The ceiling is unchanged at 48 GB, which is what protects the machine. What changed is how it is
# divided: an agent that balloons now has 16 GB to balloon into rather than 12, and the ordinary
# agents never wanted more than about 4.3 anyway. Fewer agents also means fewer of them able to
# balloon at once, which is the case the ceiling exists for.
#
# **Neither this nor the grouping is a fix.** Something makes one agent occasionally need three times
# what its neighbours need, and nobody has explained that -- see the note above about Native wanting
# twelve times the JVM's memory for the same code. The most promising account is that Scala Native's
# collector scans the stack conservatively, so garbage that a stack word happens to look like a
# pointer to cannot be proven dead; a fresh process is then the only thing that reclaims it, which is
# exactly what this script provides and why it works at all.

# one deleted came back at exactly 4s and satisfied `elapsed > LIMIT` being false. Verified by
# deleting it: the test said PASS.

# So the OOM half runs with the outer limit set far away, and asserts the cut happened nowhere near
# it. The silent half keeps a short limit, and asserts the run was NOT cut before it.
